There is a lot of possible missing fields and such in ccda data. This tool is
going to need to have profiles per facility so we can make intelligent decisions
about ambiguity instead of just propogating it. I also want to be able to
collect statistics about the problems present in formats, and have the option to
reject them under chosen conditions.

After parsing, we also get to desing a representation. It may also make sense to
have the representation be parameterized. For analytics many fields aren't
interesting but for medical work many fields do matter.
